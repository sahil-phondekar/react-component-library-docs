## Installation

To get started with the library in your project, you can easily install it from npm.

### Step 1: Install the Library

Run the following command to install the component library into your React project:

```bash
npm install @sahilphondekar/react-component-library
```

If you're using Yarn, you can install it using:

```bash
yarn add @sahilphondekar/react-component-library
```

### Step 2: Import and Use Components

Once the package is installed, you can start using the components in your project. Hereâ€™s an example of how to import and use the `Button` component:

```jsx
import { Button } from "@sahilphondekar/react-component-library";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Button color="blue" size="lg">
    Click Me
  </Button>
);
```

### Step 3: Styling with Tailwind CSS (Optional)

If you havenâ€™t already set up Tailwind CSS in your project, you can follow the [official Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to configure it. The component library works seamlessly with Tailwind, so you can benefit from the utility-first styling out of the box.
